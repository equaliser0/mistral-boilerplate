              At Speakjourney, we believe that language learning is not just
              about mastering words; it’s about immersing yourself in cultures,
              connecting with people, and embarking on a transformative journey.
              Our innovative web3 language learning platform offers more than
              just language lessons; it offers an immersive experience where
              language and culture intersect, creating a vibrant space for
              exploration, learning, and personal growth.

            <h1 className="mt-5">Our Vision</h1>
            <p className="mt-5 mx-5 mx-md-2">
              Speakjourney was born from a vision to revolutionize the way
              languages are learned. We understand the struggles faced by
              learners — the challenge of moving from textbook proficiency to
              confident real-world communication. That’s why we’ve crafted an
              environment that goes beyond the traditional classroom, allowing
              you to step into a world where language is a living, breathing
              entity.
